# 👋 Hey, I'm Pankaj

I build things quietly.  
Not a pro, not a guru — just someone who loves making useful tools.  
I look like a noob, but I’ve picked up a lot of knowledge on the way.  
Still learning every day.

## 🔧 What I’m Working On

- **Dummy Payload Forge** – a fast dummy data generator  
  https://github.com/pankajjjat/Dummy-Data-Generator

- File organizers, automation scripts, small CLIs  
- Exploring stock market automation & data tools  
- Always experimenting with something new

## 🧠 My Background (Simple Version)

I’ve jumped through different fields:

- Banking  
- Digital marketing  
- Civil engineering  
- Tech & automation  

Not an expert in any one thing…  
but I understand a little bit of everything — and it helps.

## 🛠️ Tools I Like Using

- Python  
- Bash / PowerShell  
- Git & GitHub  
- Linux & Windows  
- FastAPI  
- Automation tools  

Nothing fancy. Just what works.

### Thanks for visiting.  
I’m still learning — still building — still improving.
